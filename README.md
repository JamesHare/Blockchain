# Blockchain
An implementation of Blockchain technology in Java

# Purpose
The purpose of the project is two fold.

1. I wanted to push myself to learn the Blockchain technology. It has many uses both in the cryptocurrency world and in industries outside of that field.

2. I wanted to learn more about using Git and source control within Atom.

# Important Note
This is a work-in-progress. I will add to this README file as I go.
